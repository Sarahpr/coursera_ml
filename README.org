These are my solutions to Andrew Ng's machine learning course. It has been quite
a learning experience. Coding them in Python has helped me to learn how to use
=numpy= and =scipy= more efficiently. 

Along the way I have found solutions by other learners very helpful, in
particular those by [[https://github.com/kaleko/CourseraML][kaleko]] and [[https://github.com/deyachatterjee/ml-andrewng-python][deyachatterjee]]. Also thanks to [[https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments][dibgerge]] for
translating the original Matlab/Octave questions to Python. Even though I
largely wrote my own solutions, those were very helpful when I got stuck with
some =numpy= issues.

Feel free to use these as you want, the questions are in [[https://github.com/e-eight/coursera_ml/tree/master/assignments][assignments]], and the
data is in [[https://github.com/e-eight/coursera_ml/tree/master/data][data]].
